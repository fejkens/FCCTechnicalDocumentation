      <h2>What is CSS Grid?</h2>

      <p>CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that elements children (which become Grid Items).</p>

      <h2>CSS Grid vs Flexbox</h2>

      <p>No. Well. Mostly No.<br/></p>

      <p>Grid is much newer than Flexbox and has a bit less browser support. That's why it makes perfect sense if people are wondering if CSS grid is here to replace Flexbox.<br/></p>

      <p>To put a point on it:<br/></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Grid can do things Flexbox can't do.</li>
        <li>Flexbox can do things Grid can't do.</li>
        <li>They can work together: a grid item can be a flexbox container. A flex item can be a grid container.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Even though Grid is pretty new, we have lots of articles about it, including a getting started article, an article about a basic layout done multiple ways, and a complete guide.<br/></p>

      <p>If you hadn't heard the trumpets blaring, March 2017 was the banner month for Grid. It was released, completely unprefixed and ready-to-go, in Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Safari. Even Edge supports it, albiet an older version of the spec, which you can get some support for by using Autoprefixer.<br/></p>

      <p>So, does Grid replace Flexbox?<br/></p>

      <p>It seems a little complicated at first. Especially if you're just starting to get a grip on the weird, alien syntax of Flexbox. Now there is a whole other syntax to learn? Sheesh.<br/></p>

      <p>Here's some things Grid is specifically better at than Flexbox:<br/></p>

      <ul>

        <li>Making whole page layouts. It's better for that even just considering layout performance reasons.</li>
        <li>Making literal grids. Like X columns with Y gap between them homegrown framework stuff. grid-gap is wonderful, as gutters are the main pain point of grid systems.</li>
        <li>Requiring less media query intervention with really powerful functionality like auto layout, minmax(), repeat(), and auto-fill. Here's a neat idea.</li>

      </ul>

        <p>And another huge one: Grid can position elements in 2 dimensions. Both columns and rows. That's a first. Rachel Andrew once made that very clear:<br/></p>

        <p>Flexbox is essentially for laying out items in a single dimension – in a row OR a column. Grid is for layout of items in two dimensions – rows AND columns.<br/></p>
